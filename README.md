# Bunker32
This repository contains some scripts (made by me) that I wanted to open source from Bunker 32, if you expected building, that is a no no.

# Observation
Some scripts here are not that good and you should not really try to use them without a refactor, some won't even work if I might have forgotten to add something here (if I did you can either DM me or create a new [Issue](https://github.com/Flashthedev/Bunker32/issues/new)

# Organization
Scripts with .client.lua are client scripts, .server.lua are server scripts and the ones with only .lua are module scripts.
